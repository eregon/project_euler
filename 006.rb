# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385
# 
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025
# 
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# 
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
