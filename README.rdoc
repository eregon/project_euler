= Project Euler
This is my solutions of Project Euler in Ruby.
C is used in the rare cases it is necessary.

It is written in very recent Ruby, so you likely need a trunk(or 1.9.2) build to run them.

Scripts taking more than one second have their times written next to the result.

My aim is to show examples of the usage of Ruby in such problems.

If you are trying to solve some Euler Project's problems, please search on your own first ;)
