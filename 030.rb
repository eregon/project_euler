Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

    1634 = 1^(4) + 6^(4) + 3^(4) + 4^(4)
    8208 = 8^(4) + 2^(4) + 0^(4) + 8^(4)
    9474 = 9^(4) + 4^(4) + 7^(4) + 4^(4)

As 1 = 1^(4) is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
